# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What is the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?
SELECT 
artist_name 
,track_name
,AVG(popularity)
,AVG(danceability)
,AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#2. Who are the Top 10 artists by popularity?
SELECT 
track_name
,artist_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#3. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT 
artist_name
,MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#OR

SELECT 
artist_name
,duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

#4. What artists had more than one song in the Top 50 Spotify songs of 2021?
SELECT DISTINCT artist_name, COUNT(track_id)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(track_id)>=2

#5. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT 
track_name
,artist_name
,popularity
,AVG(danceability) AS danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#6. Use a CTE to identify artists with an average popularity of 90 or above and label them as a “Top Star”. 
WITH tempTable AS (
    SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS popularity
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
)
 
SELECT artist_name, popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM tempTable
WHERE popularity>=90
